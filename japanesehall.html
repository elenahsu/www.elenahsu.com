                        <p>At Dossier Creative, I strategized and developed a framework for The Japanese Hall and Language School's future historical interpretive center.</p>

This was a client project I worked on at <a href="http://railyardlab.com/ " target="_blank ">Railyard Lab</a> for the brand and innovation firm, <a href="https://www.dossiercreative.com/ " target="_blank ">Dossier Creative</a>.</p>

                         <p>Envisioning an interpretive experience in the Japanese Hall and Language School that elevates the prominent themes of the Japanese-Canadian story while also taking into consideration the BC School Curriculum and the existing community of the Downtown Eastside.</p> 
                    
                        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
                         <p>Compiled within a comprehensive deck to hand over to the Japanese Hall and Language School, we've developed a framework for inspiring and evaluating future creative concepts using spatial, technological, and storytelling tools.</p>
                    <p>Our findings were presented to Vancouver Senior City Planners, Nikkei National Museum and Cultural Centre, and The Japanese Hall and Language School's architect partners. The final project became the foundation for the Historic District application for Japantown.</p>

                        <p>Some highlights of our research included:</p>
                        <p>A historic walking tour led by Laura Saimoto, the Japanese Hall and Language School director. She gave us a tour of Powell Street and its history. This was syntheized into an extensive historic timeline and helped inform the narrative of the interpretive experience.</p>
                        <p>A two-hour interview with six Japanese-Canadian community elders who shared their childhood experiences growing up in an internment camp. We learned about the resilience of the community and how it shaped their perspecitves and identity.</p>
