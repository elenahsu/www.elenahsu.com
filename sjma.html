                        <h6>Creating a Musical Life</h6>
                       
                       <p>Through a commitment to their children’s growth and to their community, SJMA creates a space for their children to musically discover and pursue the joy of creativity, collaboration, and achievement. Using music as an agent of social development, SJMA teaches their children the beauty of music so that music can teach them the beauty of life. Within the Downtown Eastside, SJMA has been a long established non-profit organization pushing for social transformation and generational change.</p>

                         <p>With the website refresh, my task was to iterate on the previous website design done at Dossier Creative. Based off of the <a href="https://www.nextafter.com/ " target="_blank ">Next After</a> and strategy work, insights that help non-profits reach more people, acquire more donors, and raise more money helped lay the foundation for further elevating SJMA's online experience.</p>
                         <p> Donors needed to see meaningful ways to contribute, as well as the impact of their donations and clear messaging of SJMA's values, mission, and offerings.</p>

                                <p> As SJMA's community grows and fosters overtime, I wanted to create a website that can also grow alongside it. I designed and developed it using components that are flexible and easy to edit to withstand the test of time and to remain relevant to their audiences.</p>
